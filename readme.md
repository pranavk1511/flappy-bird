# Flappy Bird Web App

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

## Features

- Start the game by pressing "Enter"
- Control the bird by pressing the "Space" key to make it jump
- The game becomes easier to play with reduced gravity and higher jumps
- Displays the score during gameplay and a "Game Over" message when the game ends

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Press "Enter" to start the game.
3. Press "Space" to make the bird jump.
4. Try to navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes to score points.
5. If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game is over and displays your score.
